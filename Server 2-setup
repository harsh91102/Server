# 🎬 Secure Media Streaming with Jellyfin + Tailscale

This guide helps you set up a **Jellyfin media server** and access it **securely from anywhere using Tailscale**.

✅ No port forwarding  
✅ No public IP needed  
✅ Encrypted peer-to-peer connections using WireGuard

---

## 🔧 What You'll Need

- A Linux PC, Windows, macOS, or Raspberry Pi (to host Jellyfin)  
- A [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) account (free for personal use)  
- Internet connection  
- (Optional) Docker for easier Jellyfin deployment

---

## 📥 Step-by-Step Installation

### Step 1: Install Tailscale

#### On Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
sudo tailscale up

On Windows/macOS:
Download and install from: https://tailscale.com/download
Log in with your preferred email/GitHub account.

On Raspberry Pi:
Same as Linux — use the command above.

🔐 Once installed, log in and get your Tailscale IP.

Step 2: Install Jellyfin
Option A: Docker (Recommended)
Install Docker and Docker Compose:


sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose -y

version: '3.3'

services:
  jellyfin:
    image: jellyfin/jellyfin
    container_name: jellyfin
    network_mode: "host"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      - ./cache:/cache
      - ./media:/media
    restart: unless-stopped
Start Jellyfin:


docker compose up -d
Option B: Native Installation (Linux)

sudo apt install apt-transport-https
sudo apt install jellyfin
For detailed platform-specific installs, check: Jellyfin Downloads

Step 3: Access Jellyfin via Tailscale
On the host machine:
Open Jellyfin at http://localhost:8096

On another device in your Tailscale network:
Use the Tailscale IP of the host machine:


http://<TAILSCALE-IP>:8096
✅ Example:
If the host's Tailscale IP is 100.115.92.33, access it from your phone (with Tailscale installed) at:


http://100.115.92.33:8096
🔐 Why This is Secure
Jellyfin is not exposed to the internet

Only devices in your Tailscale network can connect

All communication is encrypted using WireGuard

📁 Folder Structure (if using Docker)
bash
Copy
Edit
/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── config/         # Jellyfin config files
├── cache/          # Transcoding cache
└── media/          # Your videos, music, etc.
🧠 Bonus Ideas
Set a static Tailscale IP for Jellyfin using tailscale serve

Use mobile Tailscale app to stream on the go

Add multiple media libraries (Movies, TV, Music)
